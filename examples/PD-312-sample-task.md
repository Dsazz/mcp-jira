## Description

Implement Jira integration for MCP tools to allow fetching assigned tickets and creating task files from Jira issues.

The integration should include the following features:

1. Fetch all issues assigned to the current user
2. Fetch details of a specific issue by key
3. Create a markdown task file from a Jira issue

## Subtasks

- [Done] PD-313: Set up Jira API client
- [In Progress] PD-314: Implement issue fetching
- [To Do] PD-315: Implement markdown conversion
- [To Do] PD-316: Create task file generation

## Notes for Cursor Agent

This task requires implementing Jira API integration using the jira-client package. The implementation should follow the existing project structure and patterns.

Key considerations:

- Secure handling of API credentials
- Error handling for API requests
- Proper formatting of markdown output
- Integration with existing MCP tools framework

Dependencies:

- jira-client
- marked (for markdown processing)

The implementation should be testable and maintainable, with clear separation of concerns between API interaction, data processing, and tool registration.
